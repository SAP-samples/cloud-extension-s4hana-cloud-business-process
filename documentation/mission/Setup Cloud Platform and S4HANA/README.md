# Setup Connectivity and Extensibility

## Register Your SAP S/4HANA Cloud System

To build extension applications for your SAP S/4HANA Cloud system, you need to connect your SAP S/4HANA Cloud system to your SAP Business Technology Platform global account.

To be able to do this, in respect to authorizations you must be: 

- an administrator of the SAP Business Technology Platform global account 

- an administrator of the SAP S/4HANA Cloud system. 

### SAP Business Technology Platform

1. In your SAP Business Technology Platform Cockpit, open your global account and choose
*Systems*.

2. In the Systems panel, choose *Register System*.


 ![Register System](./images/setup1.png)


3. In the *Register System* dialog box, enter a name for the SAP S/4HANA Cloud system you want to connect.

- Recommendation: use a name that uniquely identifies this system, for example, system ID.
- Example: >S/4HANA Cloud system name<

4. In the Type dropdown list, choose *SAP S/4HANA Cloud*.

5. Choose *Register*.

 ![Choose Register](./images/setup2.png)

6. The SAP Business Technology Platform generates an integration token so the SAP S/4HANA Cloud system administrator can configure integration with the SAP Cloud Platform from your SAP S/4HANA Cloud system.
 
7. Copy the integration token and close the dialog box.

 ![Token](./images/setup3.png)

### SAP S/4HANA Cloud

1. Log onto your SAP S/4HANA Cloud tenant.

2. Navigate to *Home -> Communication Management* tab and choose the tile *Maintain SAP Cloud Platform Extensions*.

 ![Maintain](./images/setup4.png)

3. On the *Maintain SAP Cloud Platform Extensions* screen in the Integration section, choose *New*.

 ![New](./images/setup5.png)

4. In the Integration Token field, paste in the integration token generated and copied from the SAP Business Technology Platform.

 ![Paste](./images/setup6.png)

5. Enter a description for your system integration token.

- Recommendation: use the same name you entered in SAP Business Technology Platform when you generated the token.
- Example: >S/4HANA Cloud system name<

6. Choose *Save*.

- A new entry is displayed for your system in the table with the status *Enabling*.
- Wait for a few seconds.
- After the automated integration, the status of your system integration changes to *Enabled*.
- The same takes place on the SAP Business Technology Platform side. You will see the system as *Registered* – potentially after a quick refresh.


## Set Up Entitlements for Your Subaccount

After you have connected the SAP S/4HANA Cloud system (with status *Enabled* in your SAP S/4HANA Cloud tenant) to the SAP Business Technology Platform, you need to configure entitlements to make this system accessible in the SAP Business Technology Platform subaccount in which you want to build your extension application.

In the next steps you will configure the entitlements and assign the corresponding quota and service plans to the subaccount in which the extension application will reside.

Hint: Please note that as a prerequisite both a subaccount with Cloud Foundry enabled and a space need to have been created. In case you have not created a subaccount or a space yet, follow the instructions given in the documentation. 

So in case that you have no subaccount in place you would roughly have to follow these steps:

1. Create a Subaccount

2. Enable Cloud Foundry

3. Create a Space

# Create Event Mesh Instance

**SAP Business Technology Platform:** Create a new service instance for SAP Event Mesh

When you create a new service instance for SAP Event Mesh, you create a new messaging client, which then receives events sent from your registered SAP S/4HANA Cloud system. The parameters you enter in the JSON file are the service descriptors that are later visible on the Messaging Client UI and dictate the rules to be used for creating queues and their subscriptions.

1. Go to the SAP Business Technology Platform Cockpit.

2. Open your subaccount and then your space (in which you want to create the service instance).

3. In the Navigation area, choose *Services* --> *Service Marketplace*

4. Choose the *Event Mesh* tile.


 ![EM Tile](./images/setup29.png)


5. Click on *Create*.

6. Select *Event Mesh* from the Service Drop Down

7. Select *default* from the Service Plan Drop Down

8. Enter the *Instance Name:* use *messaging_georel* for the instance name


 ![Instance Name](./images/setup30.png)


9. Click *Next*

10. Copy the template into the parameter field and adjust relevant data:

- Line 3: emname
- Line 11 and 16: namespace

Example:

```
{

"emname": "EMGeo",
"namespace": "sap/georelations/1", "version": "1.1.0",
"options": {
"management": true, "messagingrest": true, "messaging": true
}, "rules": {
"queueRules": { "publishFilter": [
"${namespace}/*"
], "subscribeFilter": [
"${namespace}/*", "sap/S4HANAOD/1908/*"
] },
"topicRules": { "publishFilter": [
"${namespace}/*"
], "subscribeFilter": [
"${namespace}/*", "sap/S4HANAOD/1908/*"
] }

} 
}
```

In case of it being unclear what namespace to use you can look it up in the SAP S/4HANA Cloud system. Go to the event channel configuration as described above in the S/4 configuration section and find the relevant topic space there.

11. Click on *Create*.

12. Once the instance has been created you can check on it in the SAP Business Technology Platform Cockpit. Click on the 3 dots and select Create Service Key


![Instance CP Cockpit](./images/setup31.png)

13. Provide a name for the service key

14. Click on create 

15. Click on '1 key' under credentials. 

16. Click on Download to download the service key. 

# Enable Event Mesh Cockpit (Optional)

In case that you would like to access the Event Mesh Cockpit, you need to subscribe to SAP Event Mesh and assign a number of roles to your user.

Hint: There is no need to access the SAP Event Mesh Cockpit in this scenario, it would allow for a better understanding though. Plus that it allows you to explore the event format etc.

1. Subscribe to Event Mesh

2. Go through the subscription process and select *standard* Subscription from the list


![Click](./images/setup33.png)


Once the subscription is completed you'll find additional Role Collections for Event Mesh available in your subaccount.
 
3. Assign newly created role collections to your users

- Select *Subaccount*
- Select *Security* → *Trust Configuration*
- Click on your identity provider (e.g. SAP ID Service)
 
4. Provide email address of user to access eventing UIs
  
5. Click *Show Assignments*

6. Click *Assign Role Collection*

7. Select the Role Collection called *Enterprise Messaging Developer* from the drop-down and click *Assign Role Collection*
