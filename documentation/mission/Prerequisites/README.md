# DISCLAIMER
This mission is originally developed using SAP Event Mesh service which is only supported as CPEA service. Its sucessor service **SAP Integration Suite, advanced event mesh** is rolled out as BTPEA service (For more details on CPEA and BTPEA please visit (Consumption-Based Commercial Model)[https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/what-is-consumption-based-commercial-model], for comparision of SAP Event Mesh and SAP Integration Suite Advanced Event Mesh please visit (this blog)[https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/sap-integration-suite-advanced-event-mesh-vis-%C3%A0-vis-sap-event-mesh-and-sap/ba-p/13531535]).  Hence the mission will only work with SAP Event Mesh.

# Extensibility on SAP Business Technology Platform

You can easily build extension applications on SAP Business Technology Platform to **extend and enhance SAP solutions without disrupting core processes**. Itâ€™s easy to integrate your systems, set up communication between them and SAP Business Technology Platform so you can start building cloud-native extensions quickly and concentrate all your efforts on developing the new logic.

The SAP Business Technology Platform extensions concept provides:

- Standard connections to SAP backend systems/LoBs
- Ease of discovery and consumption of **APIs and events**
- Central **event bus** for all event sources (SAP Event Mesh)

The Extensibility services are fully integrated in the SAP Business Technology Platform Cockpit where you can register your SAP S/4HANA Cloud systems (release 1905 and higher). They support extension applications that run on Cloud Foundry runtime (not Neo). We will use the SAP S/4HANA Cloud Extensibility service available from the SAP Business Technology Platform Service Marketplace.

# Steps

Following the how-to guides provided, you will:

1. Check on the **prerequisites**
2. **Register your SAP S/4HANA Cloud backend** (release 1905 or higher) on the SAP Business Technology Platform
3. Set up service plan **entitlements** (SAP S/4HANA Cloud Extensibility and SAP Event Mesh) for your newly registered system from your SAP Business Technology Platform subaccount
4. Create **service instances** of the SAP S/4HANA Cloud Extensibility service 
5. **Configure events** in your SAP S/4HANA Cloud system to send Business Partner Created and Business Partner Changed events to SAP Event Mesh
6. Create an **SAP Event Mesh service instance** to receive Business Partner events from SAP S/4HANA Cloud system
